# Saint Louis Poker Website Template

## Overview
This project is a template for a Poker website that I created for my friends and me. The live version of this template can be found here. It is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) React app hosted on Google Firebase, with Google Firestore serving as the backend. The web app consists of 4 separate pages that are interconnected using `react-router-dom`.


## Requirements

If you want to replicate this project with your friends you will need to have the following downloaded or an account:

  - React [download React here](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
  - Node JS [download Node JS here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
  - Google Firebase [create an account here](https://firebase.google.com/)
  - Google Firestore Database: Once you have a Firebase account, set up a Firestore Database through the Firebase console.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JackMcPhillips1543/SaintLouisPoker`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure Firebase: Replace the Firebase config in src/firebase.js with your own Firebase project credentials.
4. Replace the environment variables: Go through the code and replace the database name with your own
5. Make the website yours! Feel free to change the CSS around to your liking and change the players in `PlayerData.js` to your Friends!
6. Run the app locally: `npm start`

You should now have the project running locally on your machine! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me, I am always looking for ways to improve my app.
